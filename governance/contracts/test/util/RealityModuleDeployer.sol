/**
 * @title RealityModuleDeployer
 * @notice Brings up a live `RealityModuleETH` v2.0.0 for tests, working around a version mismatch in the
 *         pinned dependency set.
 * @dev `new RealityModuleETH(...)` does not work here. The constructor calls `setUp`, which calls
 *      `__Ownable_init()`. zodiac-module-reality v2.0.0 was written against OpenZeppelin Upgradeable
 *      <= 4.3, where `__Ownable_init` carried `initializer`, so `setUp` has no initializer modifier of its
 *      own. `contracts/lib/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable` is pinned at v4.9.6, where `__Ownable_init`
 *      carries `onlyInitializing` instead, so construction reverts "Initializable: contract is not
 *      initializing".
 *
 *      The workaround runs the real `setUp`, with its real requires and `transferOwnership`, against the
 *      real runtime code: etch the runtime bytecode (the contract has no immutables, so it needs no
 *      constructor-time initialization), open the initialization window by hand, call `setUp`, then close
 *      it. Slot 0 is `Initializable`'s: byte 0 is `_initialized` (uint8), byte 1 is `_initializing` (bool).
 *
 *      This is a fixture workaround, not a shortcut around the module's own logic. It disappears if
 *      `openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable` is ever re-pinned to a 4.2/4.3 release, which is what the
 *      deployed mastercopy was compiled against.
